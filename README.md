* All total, there are approximately, 72,458 employees who may be expected to retire from Pewlett Hackard.  

* From the group of identified employees nearing retirement, approximately 70.17% (50,842 employees) have either senior or managerial roles at the company. 

* Additionally, it seems that the company should consider promoting their mentorship program. There are a total of 1,549 employees that meet the criteria to serve as mentors. 

* From this sub population group, 815 (about 52.61%) of the cohorts have either executive or senior level roles at the company. 

#summary
Our analysis shows that the company should expect approximately 72,500 employees to retire from their positions in the near future. This figure also does not account for those lower level employees who leave their current positions for positions elsewhere during the same time frame. As such, the 72,500 employee vacancies should be treated as the lowest level amount of expected departures in the near future. 

The data further shows that there are only about 1,549 employees eligible to serve as mentors. To fill the vacancies, this would amount to approximately 1 mentor to train over 40 employees each. This may be too much of a burden on the mentors and could result in additional departures due to workloads. 

The company would be advised to lower the criteria for mentorship program eligibility such as to reduce the number of mentors to mentees to a more reasonable level of about 1 mentor per 15 employees. This would be similar to the average amount of students per instructor ratios at higher education institutions.
